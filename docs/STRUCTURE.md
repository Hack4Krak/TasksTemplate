# Tasks structure

All tasks should be defined in `tasks/` directory in separate directory for each task.
Tasks have strictly defined files structure:
- [`config.yaml`](structure/config.md) - task configuration file
- [`assets/`](structure/assets.md) - directory with task assets
- [`pictures/`](structure/pictures.md) - directory with icon and background pictures
- [`src/`](structure/src.md) - source code for task implementation

If you want to learn more about task configuration file, please refer to corresponding file in [documentation](structure/) directory.
